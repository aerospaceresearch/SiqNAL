Demonstration
===================

To run this project after installing dependencies, open terminal and ``cd`` to
same directory that of project and execute ``main.py`` file.

::

    python3 main.py

File Import
```````````````````````````````````
Both formats of SDR recordngs(.dat & .wav) is supported by this project. For 
importing file you will be prompted for two options

* Single File Analysis
	Single file is select for signal detection where one has to specify file location, 
	sampling frequency and centre frequency manually using import screen gui as 
	shown below.

		File Import Option

* Folder Import
	This is the server version of this project which automatically import and analyzes 
	files sequentially. To import metadata associated with the file JSON file with same 
	name as signal file is required. Any new file added to the folder is also imported and 
	analyzed automatically. Below image shows how to select folder for analysis.

Waterfall Diagrams
```````````````````````````````````````
For each signal file analyzed a waterfall image is saved which shows visually presence of signals
in different frequency bands as depicted in images below.

		B1) NOAA Signal Waterfall(Zoomed Spectrum)

		:figclass: align-center

		C1) Funcube Signal Waterfall(Zoomed Spectrum)

In the plots A1 one can see transmission made by ISS to itâ€™s ground centre with time region of no 
transmission. In plot B1 we can see presence of signal at NOAA-15 frequency with doppler shifting. 
In plot C1 beacon type signal can be observed emitted at small time intervals.

  
Frequency bands & complex bandpass filtering
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

After importing signal file along with required meta-data our program goes through the database of 
satellites which is provided in JSON format, does doppler correction and selects those satellites whose 
frequencies can be present in the signal file. Based upon the frequency band of satellites complex 
bandpass filter is constructed. 

  
Output
````````````````````````````````````

Below are the screenshots of output on terminal of ISS, NOAA & Funcube respectively. Only that 
frequency band is include in which presence of signal is detected.
